# Git Cheatsheet

* `git reset` - upstage all files you might have staged with `git add`
* `git checkout .` - revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root)
* `git clean -fdx` - remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain
* `git add -u` - stage files that have changed without adding new files to staging area


* `git branch -a` - shows remote and local branches
* `git fetch origin` - fetches remote branches so that you can check them out locally
