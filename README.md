# Notes and Cheatsheets

This is just my personal notepad for key-commands and customized
key-bindings across applications.

I edit in Markdown so that I can view nicely formatted documents from any
web-browser using GitHub (even on my phone) if I want to review something that I'm trying to commit to memory.
